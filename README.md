# Feature-Based-Categorization-of-Product-Reviews-
This project is an implementation of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to identify the important features of a product being reviewed by the customers and its corresponding sentiment. This is a sample of a larger web-application which maintains a MongoDB database to store collections of most popular features being talked about (Trending Features) and performs analysis of the user satisfaction regarding each feature.
